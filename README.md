Work Day Scheduler


## Description 

This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. The background story of this project is as an employee with a busy schedule i must create a daily planner that can manage my time effectively.

The purpose of this homework assignment is to test the students knowledge of working with JavaScript and linking it to the HTML and CSS as well.  The JavaScript displays the students ability to set variable, write functions, create elements, traverse the DOM, store data locally, add event listeners, create on click elements, create buttons all while using JQuery.  The goal is to create a schedule that can locally store the data so that when the page refreshes it remains. The page containse a clear button which removes the text content on click. The Work Day Scheduler has a working clock that displays the time of day and as the day progresses, the colors of the text boxes changes to correspond to current time, past and future. The webpage should be responsive on mobile screens as well as desktop screens.
